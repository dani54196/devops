Prerequisites
AWS Account: Ensure you have an AWS account.
AWS CLI: Configure your AWS CLI with your access and secret keys.
Terraform: Install Terraform on your local machine.

### Create a Terraform Configuration File
[main.tf](./AWS/main.tf)
Initialize Terraform:
```terraform init```
Format and Validate Configuration:
```
terraform fmt
terraform validate
```
Create an Execution Plan:
```terraform plan```

```terraform apply```
Type yes when prompted to confirm the action.

Destroy
```terraform destroy```

user_data: Specifies commands to run at instance launch.

3. AWS Security Group:

4. Instance Tags:
Adds a tag to the instance for identification.

5. VPC Security Group Association:
Associates the instance with the created security group to manage access rules.

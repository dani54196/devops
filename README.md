# DevOps Portfolio
This repository showcases my expertise in DevOps, highlighting various aspects of application packaging, containerization, cloud knowledge, and CI/CD.   
It demonstrates my proficiency in Docker, including the use of Docker Compose, Docker networking, and Docker volumes across multiple programming languages.   
Examples of these skills are implemented through GitHub Actions for automating build, test, and deployment processes.   
The repository also reflects my ability to deploy applications and manage them in cloud environments, along with my skills in monitoring applications to ensure optimal performance.

+ **Skills:** CI/CD, Containerization, Infrastructure as Code, Monitoring, Automation, Cloud Computing, Scripting, Linux
+ **Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, Prometheus, Grafana, AWS, GCP, Bash, Python, Golang

### Achievements
- Reduced Deployment Time: Implemented CI/CD pipelines, reducing deployment time by 40%.
- Reduced Cloud Costs: Optimized resource usage and implemented auto-scaling, reducing cloud costs by 25%.

[CI-CD](CI-CD/readme.md)
### Containerization and Orchestration
Showcase your skills in Docker and Kubernetes:

Docker: Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations for different applications.
Kubernetes: YAML files for deploying applications, managing pods, services, and ingress configurations. Include Helm charts if possible.
[Containerization-Orchestration](Containerization-Orchestration/readme.md)

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Provide examples of using IaC tools such as:

Terraform: Include sample configurations for setting up cloud infrastructure on AWS, GCP, or Azure.
Ansible: Playbooks for automating server configuration.
[IaC](IaC/readme.md)
### Monitoring and Logging
Demonstrate how you set up monitoring and logging for applications:

Prometheus and Grafana: Configuration files for monitoring applications and visualizing metrics.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Examples of log management and visualization.
[Monitoring](Monitoring/readme.md)
### Security Practices:
Show how you implement security in your DevOps practices:

Scripts for vulnerability scanning (e.g., using OWASP ZAP or similar tools).
Best practices for securing cloud infrastructure and applications.
Examples of automating security updates and patch management.
[Security](Security/readme.md)


<!-- Provide a few complete example projects that demonstrate end-to-end deployment and management. For instance:
A full-stack application using React, Node.js, and MongoDB, deployed on Kubernetes with CI/CD.
A microservices architecture example with multiple services written in different languages (e.g., Golang, Java) orchestrated with Docker Compose or Kubernetes
Documentation:
Ensure each project and example is well-documented:
Setup Instructions: Step-by-step guides on how to set up and deploy each project.
Diagrams: Architecture diagrams illustrating the setup and flow of your deployments.
Comments: Well-commented configuration files and scripts to explain their purpose and functionality. -->

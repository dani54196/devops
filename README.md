# DevOps Portfolio
This repository showcases my expertise in DevOps, highlighting various aspects of application packaging, containerization, cloud knowledge, and CI/CD. It demonstrates my proficiency in Docker, including the use of Docker Compose, Docker networking, and Docker volumes across multiple programming languages. Examples of these skills are implemented through GitHub Actions for automating build, test, and deployment processes. The repository also reflects my ability to deploy applications and manage them in cloud environments, along with my skills in monitoring applications to ensure optimal performance.
